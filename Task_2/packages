1. SciPy
 * SciPy is a Python library used for scientific and technical computing. In the context of Bark, it is used to write the generated audio array to a .wav file.
 * Specifically, the function scipy.io.wavfile.write() is used to save the audio in the standard .wav format
Installation:
  pip install scipy
2. IPython
 * IPython provides a rich interactive environment for Python, and its IPython.display.Audio function is used to play audio directly in Jupyter notebooks or similar environments.
 * This function allows playback of the generated audio within the notebook environment, making it easier to evaluate the output without needing an external player.
Installation
   pip install ipython
3. Torch (PyTorch)
* Bark is typically built on top of PyTorch, one of the most widely used deep learning frameworks. PyTorch is responsible for loading the pre-trained models, running inference, and handling the underlying neural network computations.
* If not already installed, Torch needs to be installed separately for Bark to function.
Installation:
  pip install torch
Installation Example for Bark's Dependencies:
  pip install scipy ipython numpy torch
